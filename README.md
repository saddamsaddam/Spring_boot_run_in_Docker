You are using **Windows 11 Home Single Language** (Version 23H2).  

### **Can You Run Docker?**  
âœ… **Yes, but you need WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V** since Windows 11 Home does **not** support Hyper-V.  

### **What to Do Next?**  
1. **Enable WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**  
   Run this in **PowerShell (as Admin)**:
   ```sh
   wsl --install
   ```
   Then restart your PC.


Great! You have successfully installed **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on WSL 2**. Now, let's verify if Docker is working properly.

---

### **1. Check if WSL is Running in Version 2**
Run the following command in **PowerShell (Admin)**:
```sh
wsl -l -v
```
It should show `Ubuntu` running on **WSL 2**. If not, upgrade it:
```sh
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
```

---

### **2. Install Docker on Ubuntu (WSL 2)**
Now, in your **Ubuntu terminal**, run:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```

After installation, start the Docker service:
```sh
sudo service docker start
```

To check if Docker is running:
```sh
sudo docker --version
```

---

### **3. Run a Test Docker Container**
Run this command to test Docker:
```sh
sudo docker run hello-world
```
If everything is working, you will see a message confirming that Docker is installed correctly.

---

### **4. Allow Running Docker Without `sudo` (Optional)**
If you want to run Docker without typing `sudo` every time:
```sh
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
Then try running:
```sh
docker run hello-world
```
without `sudo`.

---

### **5. Make Docker Start Automatically on WSL**
Add this to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```sh
echo "sudo service docker start" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
This will start Docker automatically when you launch Ubuntu.

---

### **Next Steps**
- âœ… If `docker run hello-world` works, Docker is fully set up!
- ðŸš€ You can now start working with Docker images and containers.

Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
